1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And I will share my screen.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So basically one of the most asked questions for this next six months are can you all see my screen and can you hear me in case you don't let me know or just right in the chat.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Otherwise, I just start.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, so the agenda for my presentation is what do I need to start the course right, then what should I expect in the following days.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What should I do to successfully complete the bootcamp.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And of course we all want you to complete the bootcamp successful will be my point of contact and then you will meet your teaching team.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So what do I need to start the course right first very important beyond slack.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know if you are working with like for the first time it can be a little bit confusing because we are working with two different workspaces.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You have the general workspace which is the light blue one.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And there you can find every iron hacker ever and also the data pre work help channel.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And then you already received a link for the class workspace.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's like where all the daily communication takes place so it's mandatory to join there.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think not everyone joins by now.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's what I saw.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you're struggling finding the link or struggle joining select just reach out to me.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And in the class workspace you have like all your teaching team and all your colleagues.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then in terms of pre work so pre work should be ready by now.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If not please reach out to me.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The thing we are so strict on pre work deadline is at first it's you do yourself a favor because if you don't do pre work, you won't be able to follow the course.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because the course is fast paced and it's way easier for you if you have like the insights from pre work.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
On the other side your teaching team will look through the pre work and they need to provide some feedback.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And they will start this week and in order to give them a little bit time to work to go through the pre work it's mandatory to have it finished by now.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And also my advice is if you have the time now also do stage zero off career because the more you do now you will be happy during the bootcamp.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And if you already finished with pre work, enjoy the last three weekend.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or free Saturday at least. And then what should I expect in the following days.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So today is week zero we call it big zero because it's the week before your bootcamp starts and today is day zero.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then in week one you have your first day of the bootcamp on Tuesday I will send the invitation with the link and all the information.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And after this meeting today so we will start on Tuesday at 630 central European time.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And please be punctual because we will start with a presentation and afterwards you start the journey.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then what should I do to successfully complete the bootcamp.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
During the bootcamp in terms of dedication you will need to know that there will be times where you need to work outside bootcamp hours.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So you have the bootcamp hours but in terms of labs or projects for example, you will be asked to work also on other days that are not bootcamp hours.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And also you will work in individual projects but also in group projects and activities.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For the in class dynamics, please please have your camera on.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You will recognize that it's way easier and the way more familiar atmosphere if you can see each other's faces and also connecting to each other is way easier.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And also it provides the teaching team with feedback in how you're getting the content or if you're completely lost.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The mic's are turned off during the lecture time but of course if you have any questions just turn off your turn on your mic and ask the question and don't be shy asking questions, because even if you are the only one asking 100% sure you're not the only one with the question.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In terms of graduation so we don't work with greats at iron hack but we have other criteria to fulfill in order to graduate.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The first one is the attendance so you're not allowed to miss more than seven classes or you want to graduate.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And in terms of functionality if you arrive 10 minutes to late, it counts as a party and if you have three parties it counts as an absence day.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So meaning if you arrived three times 10 minutes late it counts as if you wouldn't be there for one day in terms of labs.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of course we recommend to have 100% lab completion because the labs are the perfect time to put everything you learned in practice.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So you do yourself a favor if you do 100% of the labs, but if you do less than 80% you won't graduate.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So in terms of the project with which is the third criteria to graduate, you will need to present them and do all of them by your own and they need to be up to a certain standard.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then who will be my point of contact.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There are several people involved in your iron hack experience which is firstly your lead teacher which is the lead.

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And in the field and responsible of the class performance and leading the class, you can contact him so slack, then you have two amazing teacher systems from Salu and Miguel.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They are the experts in the student experience and your goal two persons for any technical questions or support.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And you can also reach out to them on slack.

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am your program manager and responsible for a successful experience. And my aim is to that you have like the easiest experience possible and you help me with that with providing feedback so you'll ask you for filling out the survey every two weeks.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I will please you to fill out the survey because there I can see how you're doing and how we can help you in if there's something you struggle with.

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And also besides the survey I will reach out to you for a short one on one it's like a 15 minute chat.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So don't worry it's completely normal that at one point I will reach out to you.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then there is your student success manager which is one you will meet him in the second week of the bootcamp and also and to other touch points he will help you with the chop hunting, getting your profile done on LinkedIn and CV.

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And also after the bootcamp he will be the one leading your career week and also you will have the one who wants with him.

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And now this was it already from my site.

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will share my screen.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now I give the stage to your teaching team.

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, thank you Emily. Excellent.

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So nice to meet you all. I'm David. I am going to be a lead teacher for this for the next six months.

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I do have a couple of slides there's not that they're not that insightful but I will share them anyway.

62
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So let me ensure that I'm sharing the correct screen and I'm going to share the full screen because I may navigate some some other panels here.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So welcome everyone.

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Today, we are doing here that is day zero exercise where it's it's to make sure that come next Tuesday we are ready to start you will very, very quickly discover that the pace is very, very fast.

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So we tried to make sure that we're not, let's say wasting time on making sure that we have these are that program installed or that something is running or something of that sort.

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So we're going to take this moment here to make sure that we're all on the same page.

67
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I'd also like time permitting that we could go round table and have everyone doing a couple of words, your name, how do you spell it or because we are, we are very diverse cohort.

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And go to the toolkit that we're going to be using during this cohort at least in the beginning. And we'd like to start with a very, very quick presentation of who we are.

69
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Most of this content, by the way, we are going to go very quickly over it on Tuesday anyway, just in case someone is watching this on the on the recording.

70
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So we are still so if you have questions, you will still have the opportunity to ask them even if they are not like. So, here is the amazing teaching team and I'm super stoked that we have this, this team without this is these are all.

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, at least the last two are amazing people. The first one is what you got that like, but with this, you are, you are going to, you are going to see that they're all all conditions are there.

72
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So you're the teaching that's here is this three people, the first one is me, I am the V. I'm going to be our lead teacher, I have spent roughly half of my life in in consulting roles, and half of my life in more analytic flash AI roles.

73
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, I started my career in a consulting company called the same company. Then I took my machine learning, I worked for quite a few years as head of data analytics that's a very large French bank, all them to Paris.

74
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I went back to consulting a little bit for another well known consulting company, well been in company. Then I became a teacher at Ironhack. And currently, my role is as a head of AI in a company that that social media moderation and tries to get conversations on social media a little bit more civil.

75
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The rate of success here is debatable, but at least we're trying.

76
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So I've been, I thought quite a few of these of these cohorts. This is my second time doing this truly remote and part time. So you're not going to be complete.

77
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You are only going to be partial. So that's, I hope, something that we can, that we can exploit to tweak and make things work better over time.

78
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The cohort is quite large, but there is one thing here that at Ironhack that I like quite a bit is that we have a lot of a lot of leeway a lot of independence.

79
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So if you at any point find that anything in the process is not working out for you as well as it could, if you have an idea of something that, oh, this would be low hanging if we just implemented these.

80
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We spent more time on this on that. Just let us know we are not so tightly bound by the curriculum that we cannot adapt.

81
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, yeah, just keep that in mind. I'm going to give the floor to go on top with one of our two amazing TA, the controller.

82
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sorry, yours.

83
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hello everyone. First of all, let me start by saying that I really need to change this picture because I'm super mad at this photo and I'm hardly ever met.

84
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So this does this photo never met my style basically.

85
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So the camera today is lacking but next lesson is going to be way better. So hi, I'm Gonzalo, I'm from Portugal. This is my second cohort in teaching.

86
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like you, I also did the boot camp, but it was full time.

87
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it was on site. So it was a little bit different, but for sure the journey that I have, yours is going to be two or three times even better.

88
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And with everything that you're going to need to make this journey everlasting, basically. And I'm really, really stoked to be in this team as well.

89
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So yeah, let's let's accomplish some goals and some some future new of yourselves in the next six months.

90
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Excellent. Thank you so much, Gonzalo. And next up we have the meeting Miguel. Miguel.

91
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hello, hello everyone. Nice to meet you people. I'm Miguel and I'm from Valencia here in Spain.

92
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And yeah, I was also a data student from my own in Barcelona in 2020 so my course was intended to be on site I mean person but we did everything on remote so this is not the first time I'm working for remote.

93
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And after this time the boot camp I joined I know I got a TIA during three more good comes one of them was working with with David, which was a great experience so so yeah after that I, but I'm by a technology star and I did my PhD in Barcelona so

94
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I moved to Valencia to do research last year so I've been like one year doing research here in in Valencia but now I'm super happy to combine both of my of my love jobs I would say.

95
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's in and doing research. So yeah, that's everything really happy to meet you and don't miss I ask forever and we will be super happy to help you.

96
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Thank you. Thank you Miguel. So, yeah, so this is, this is the team you have. This is what we have to work with and it's going to be amazing. I'm pretty sure.

97
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So folks before we move on. Just a couple of, I mean, think some of them are repeating a little bit what I'm really sad that they really work so

98
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:06,000
first I would ask you I mean of course, we're not going to force you to do anything of course, but I would ask you to try as much as possible to keep the cameras on. It helps the teaching staff a lot because they see a lot I mean this is a remote.

99
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It already has some like impairment in communication we need to overcome it so keep the cameras on and don't don't be shy on on say like overreacting right it's we are we've been all in this like remote world for for for a while now.

100
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So if you if you if you want to send the message that something is not like fully on board just like great your eyebrow a lot right to make sure that you get that message across.

101
00:15:42,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean you don't need to but it helps. We read a lot into your your visual cues and facial expressions and so on. Also, don't be shy on using these little emotes buttons that I am trying to find here you are probably not seeing them because I don't think zoom chairs stuff but

102
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
there are ways of the molding.

103
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The reactions maybe visit. Yes. So usually I am going you'll see that I am going to ask a lot of times that like rhetorical everything okay everyone with me so far everyone.

104
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't make it so rhetorical so usually give me a thumbs up like this if if you if you are following if it's feeling fine.

105
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If I'm saying something and you're like what this guy talking about I usually reserved this mode for that.

106
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm just like oh my god what's going on here. So if I start seeing this and if I and if I don't see a lot of the other one.

107
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We use this as as as weak signals and also don't hesitate at all just to and you can say just just go over it again. I'm sorry. I'm absolutely fine with that. It's it's absolutely expected.

108
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So I'm going to point here that should discuss we are probably at least some of us are going to be in different time zones. So all times whenever I speak about times I'm talking about Central European time.

109
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm just like Spain, Germany, France. This is kind of like time block. You're in green which time it's your little bit towards just like do the quick math in your in your head.

110
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So because right now I am in Portugal. You will see that the time that is going to be shared on my screen on my screen probably doesn't match your time. And in advance because it's going to happen.

111
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So I'm wrong at some point. So make sure to clarify if I say, oh let's take a break and be back at 530 just go. I think you mean 630 right so that usually when it's a temporal impossibility it's easy to pick it up but when it's the other way around.

112
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So I don't show up an hour late because I said something wrong. Also timing you will see it's going to be very evident very quickly.

113
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So timing is very, very constrained in the boot camp. So timing is very strict right so it's going to be very like things are going to start at time I'm going to start talking at the dots.

114
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But just just bear that in mind, don't read too much into the fact that teaching staff is all either for two years or Spanish we are actually going to start on time.

115
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay, folks. So that's it. I don't know do you have any any questions so far.

116
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Those sounds good so far. So what I would like to do is I would like to spend the next five to 10 minutes. Just going over the list of software that you have that you should have installed in your computer by now it's supposed to be pre requisite

117
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that everyone in a while we get a we get a couple of like versions of things that don't necessarily align with what we install in our computer so I just wanted to, while I have my screen share, show you how things should look in your computer.

118
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Now, of course, as you see, I'm in a Windows environment. So if you are using a different environment, if you're in Linux, or if you are on a Mac, things are going to look slightly different, but only automatically.

119
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And hopefully everything that I'm going to go over is going to be something that you can recognize as being somewhere in your computer.

120
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you are meeting some of the software, or if you had trouble installing some of the software, reach out to us, you can reach out to us.

121
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
As Emily just mentioned, flag is the preferred option. It's.

122
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's a synchronous, it means you can ask the question and we can pick it up as we have time. So that's the best way of doing it.

123
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's like it's the thing that is bothering you just unmute and say, do that need you. And once we're done here, we'll stay with you.

124
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay, so whenever you're in telling any of this crap, all the options can be left on default. Everything works.

125
00:20:46,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We're going to like no bells and whistles, we're going to do vanilla everything. And something requires some registration. So just like make sure that you let us know if you use a particular moniker, a particular username that doesn't map easily to you, right?

126
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So I don't know, Dragon Slayer Lord 73 just let us know because otherwise we won't be able to find you to add you to the relevant channel.

127
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Cool. So what things should you have now, thing number one, what you must have is like this thing over here.

128
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So you should have an interface that looks like this, yours might be black screen or white screen or whatever it is. And in black, you should have two channels. Channels are these things here.

129
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Actually, are these workspaces two workspaces. And you should have two of them. One is called Iron Hat General, which I think it's this one.

130
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm actually not sure there's a lot of iron, but I think it's the one that looks like this that has that is like the blue iron, a logo. You should have been invited to this.

131
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And the other one, which for my own selfish purposes is the one I really needed to have is this one that is called.

132
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The A T T six, which stands for that analytics part time, six of September, which is the first day of our cohort. It will be the good thing is like it, it has this rainbow attack.

133
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So if you have one with a rainbow attack chances are you are you are in the right place.

134
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,000
There you have several channels. We are going to mostly be using this main general channel to communicate class announcements, things that we must remember.

135
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Like group projects, things like this, there will be announced, there will be announced here. Another thing that is very helpful here in this general channel, you can navigate the channels here, by the way.

136
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Is that king to the top, which means always here below the name of the channel, we will have relevant links.

137
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:11,000
In this case, there's a very important link here, which is a zoom link, and you will click this link to access our class. Right. So next Tuesday, six 30 maximum.

138
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I recommend a little bit earlier.

139
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Select you will click this link, zoom will open for you. It will say the one to connect with your computer sound, etc, etc. This is going to be our platform. It will always be open. You are you can, for example, if you need to join up with someone discuss something can always go there.

140
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Of course, while we're having classes, please refrain from having discussions with other people. But I think that goes without saying. So really important.

141
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So other links will show up here as necessary for time being, we just need this one. Okay. So hopefully this one, there's no one who has to have trouble accessing. If you don't have this yet.

142
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:11,000
One of those would that you must have by Tuesday, by Tuesday. So if you don't have this yet, say a little later, send us an email and we'll help you set it up. Okay. Any questions anyone with unclear how to access the classroom.

143
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Come Tuesday.

144
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Just click there and zoom will open it. Don't do it now. Otherwise, you will leave this meeting. Okay.

145
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So next.

146
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Second thing that you must have by Tuesday for sure. It's Python. And in particular, you need to have an interface by then which is Jupiter. So you should all have by now.

147
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Start and begin. If you haven't done it by now, you should all have seen this kind of interface that that that we're seeing here. Something that runs on your on your browser that has Jupiter that has little boxes.

148
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So this is the main interface that we're going to use to to to program in in Python. This is called a notebook. We're going to go over this on on on Tuesday. But hopefully you have something that looks like this in your computer.

149
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
If you don't.

150
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This is another one that we need to solve today. Okay. So just if you if you if you need something here, let us know.

151
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And now I think that this one I actually don't know if you already have access to. I'm really do they have access to the student portal already.

152
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yes, they do. Okay, because I think that's the prereq like they don't see the curriculum only the prereq part. Okay. Excellent. Okay. So the other tool that we're going to do is quite a bit.

153
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's going to be this student portal that is going to look like this. It's going to have this organization in little rectangles that we're also going to fall pills. We're going to go over this again on on the next path.

154
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
If you don't have this. This is another one of those of Oh my god, you're already going to run quite a little quite a bit if you have never seen.

155
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay, but this one also quite an important tool. So these are the Cinequanones right this this without this your data on the water you need to you need to work to get this before we start to.

156
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay.

157
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Any questions so far.

158
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
To make a quick pause here because these ones were the really, really important ones.

159
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Now just for the critical ones. So the next thing you need to have is this thing called it. And now there's a little bit of confusion because there are two things that work together, but are actually two different pieces of software there's get.

160
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And there's GitHub.

161
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Give it something that leaves in your computer that you install. And that ideally you should already have it's how you are going to submit your left and it's also one of the main tools that we use for large scale programming.

162
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And it's something that you can check if you have by going to either a command prompt or your terminal if you don't know what to access the command prompt just go in Windows go here and write CMD.

163
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And in Mac go to finder and write terminal and it should open something like this the black screen like this.

164
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And here you can just go get and actually you can just go get enter and you should see some message other than I don't know what it is.

165
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Okay, if you see anything other than I don't know what it is you're good to go.

166
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay, if you do will discuss it later. This is the thing you need to have in your computer.

167
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
To go with this, you also need to have an account on something called GitHub.

168
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So you go to a browser.

169
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Say for example Chrome, which is the one I'm going to be using. You don't need to be using Chrome. I mean, I recommend that you would be using Chrome just because then the things you will see are the same exact things that I will see.

170
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You don't need to translate thing, but you can use another browser if you are allergic to Chrome for whatever reason, and you can just go GitHub.

171
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Just go to the site GitHub and if you don't have an account sign up for one.

172
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Okay.

173
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So, I hope it's something that you can I mean there's a wizard that that let you create the account.

174
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So this is to you should also have by Tuesday because these are the things that are going to allow you to submit not only your pre work but also your labs and and as we've already discussed labs are a mandatory part of the of the experience

175
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:54,000
also, you need these things to work in programming nowadays. So it's part of the things you need to learn how to use.

176
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Now things that you don't need to have right now but you're going to have to to have at some point. So the first one is called my workbench, which is something that has these like little vaulting symbol there.

177
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Right. So ideally, you will have installed this in your computer and you will have a little rectangle here for a local instance. If you don't, that's not such a big deal when we get to SQL, we will discuss it.

178
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But a really, really, really, really important thing. If you are installing my workbench right now.

179
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So you're going to need to remember your password. If you forget your password, the only way to recover it is going to be to uninstall the whole thing and install it again.

180
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So this is one of those cases where when it talks to you to choose a password.

181
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Just like memorize it, save it somewhere. Just otherwise come week three.

182
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We're all going to spend 10 minutes here waiting for people to reset their password.

183
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Any questions so far.

184
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I see there's a few questions in chat. So let me quickly go through that. That's fine. That's fine. All that's good. I don't actually, I can't actually see if you are seeing. I'm just looking at the chat.

185
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay, Miguel, thank you. GitHub desktop app. You may want to use it or not. I am not going to use the desktop app. Mainly because I'd rather teach you the GitHub, the language that you can interact regardless of having

186
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:50,000
an interactive app or not, a graphical user interface or not. If you prefer to use the graphical user interface, that's absolutely fine. I'm answering here my nooks question.

187
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:59,000
What about GitHub desktop app? Okay. Oh, Miguel actually answered it. Thank you, Miguel, for that. Okay, cool.

188
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So that's my SQL workbench. Now, another piece of software that you need to have installed is Tableau and Tableau has again, just like it and GitHub has a dual thing.

189
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There's one thing that you install in your computer, which is called Tableau public desktop edition. And here Tableau made a mess of their naming conventions because there is something called Tableau desktop edition.

190
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And there's called something called Tableau public. And there is something called Tableau public desktop. And what we need is Tableau public desktop, which is something that installs in your computer. And that once opened looks like this.

191
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And what I recommend is that you Google Tableau public desktop, and then navigate a little bit until you find here all these options here and you go to Tableau public and you go log into Tableau public.

192
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And then here you need to sign up, and this will create an account on Tableau public, which is this thing here, the account. And once you are logged into your account, you ask to download the Tableau public desktop installer, which installs this thing in your computer.

193
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I know it's a mess, it's tedious, but hopefully it will work out. Okay, if you find this confusing, I find it confusing as well. But if you get locked, just let us know and we'll help you with this.

194
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:59,000
All the time so far. Now, another thing that you are going to need is going to be Office 365. This is mostly to have access to Excel.

195
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We are going to actually only discuss Excel far, far down the road. So if you don't have access to Office 365 yet, that is fine. We, but if you already have it for whatever reason, for your own personal reasons or for work or whatever that's going to work well as well.

196
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If you need an Office 365 account, I'm going to leave, correct me if I'm wrong, they need to speak to you.

197
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right, yes, I will send us a survey one time in the boot camp for the actual license.

198
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Anyway, this is a few months down the road. So we're fine on this. Now, one thing that I carefully recommend is that especially if you use Chrome is to get the Google Colab plugin.

199
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:11,000
This is not mandatory. You can do everything with a group of your notebook, but I personally like to use a plug in for Chrome that allows me to program in the browser directly and just just access the material of the class using the link.

200
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's very convenient. This is called Google Colab.

201
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And you don't need to install the plug in that the plugin makes it easier for things to open. They open posture. So you can just go to Chrome and go Google Colab plugin and and and install the first.

202
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The first hit there if you are using any of the modern browsers that that will save you a few seconds every day. That's essentially it's not groundbreaking, but it helps.

203
00:34:47,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay, so recommend that you do it. You don't need to. Another one that I recommend that you do is that you create a Trello account. So Trello for those of you who don't know what it is, is a project management tool. It helps you, especially in the group projects that it's also helpful to doing

204
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:25,000
in personal projects to help you program out and map out how you want your project to be done. How long things should take, where are your blockers, etc, etc. It's a nice project management tool. We do recommend that you create an account here.

205
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's free as for everything that has an account in this path. So the GitHub, the public account, and the Trello account, please send your usernames to our TA so that we can add you to anything that is class wide.

206
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

207
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So far, final thing that I would recommend you to have, even though it's not mandatory. It's one of the things that's not mandatory, but you must have it is to have an ID development environment.

208
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And usually one that works well with Python. If you install something called an Aconda, which I think is recommended in the pre work material, you should have something in your computer called spider that works perfectly well.

209
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I like to use one called the code, which kind of like looks like this. I, you just should have a place where you can just write code that is not a notebook that doesn't have this kind of like little cells.

210
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So we're going to be using IDs to essentially write the codes that we will then serve in our in our projects things that are a little bit more industrial grade than the teaching moments that we are going to be doing using the notebook

211
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay, all of these will become much more crystallized in the coming days. This is more for you to be aware that sometimes some of these screens may pop up.

212
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay, so, next question. Oh, by the way, the other man is already thing that going to assume everyone has is a zoom account that you should have. So, so you can, of course, access zoom just be at the browser.

213
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So, if you install the zoom app, you get access to a couple more features, you get to blurry our background in case you are in someplace that is busy or things like that you get to do some reaction, some emotes.

214
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It helps immersion a little bit so I do recommend that you create a zoom account you are of course not mandated to do it.

215
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Okay.

216
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes, I have one maybe so sorry, I didn't why we have to serve a trailer account.

217
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, I mean, we may invite we may create some central.

218
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We may create some central accounts where we need to invite you.

219
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So, for example, for when we have like large problem projects one way that we track your progress on the project is, is to create a line for everyone of you, where it's not really for project management is more for us to track how you are doing.

220
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So, we need to like we need to invite you, right, so you, we need to know your, like handle your tag, your username, right, so that we can invite you so that you can have your own line.

221
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, okay, I would try. Thank you, Debbie.

222
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Thank you.

223
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Cool.

224
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I noticed a couple more questions here useful to organize projects. Okay.

225
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay.

226
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Folks, I think that's it in terms of tools, anything overwhelming.

227
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Good.

228
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So that's it for the things that we have to cover before we before we get to adjourn for next Tuesday.

229
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm, I'm going to.

230
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm going to open the floor for questions, let's say, but I would also like if time per meeting.

231
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
If we could go around the table and just have a quick, quick introduction just hi, my name is X.

232
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm from country Y or whatever, like, you'd like to share.

233
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:53,000
If you want to tell it your background, your reason to join a bootcamp, something that gives us a bit of information about you.

234
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That'd be okay. And what I will recommend that we do because we're not necessarily all order in the same way in everyone's presence that I'm going to share.

235
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm going to choose the first person to go. And then that person will choose the next person to go. Okay.

236
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So we will pass the ball to someone else. Right. So I'm going to start like thing. Okay. I am the VID. I am. I'm from Portugal.

237
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I joined. I joined the boot camp because, well, because it's my job. So there we go. That's, that's me. And I'm going to pass the ball to.

238
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Hi, everyone. I don't know if you are. You are hearing me. Okay. I am from Spain, from Madrid, but I live in our apartment.

239
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm with a number of people. And that's all. And I.

240
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I try to pass the ball to Adrian.

241

261
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But I'm really good in the front there part, but I'm really bad in the coding. So that's why I enter to Ironhack to learn this part.

262

266
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:32,000

267
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So it's also like something that can boost my career and something I really, really looking forward to learn.

So I'm now working as a freelance developer.

284

285
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And it's about expanding my skills. And yeah, I hope we're all having a nice time.

303
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So understanding the importance of technology and that in our world, I decided to start starting by my own. So I decided to take courses on data analytics and also programming and finally decided to enroll the food card.

304
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So, and I'm going to meet you all. I hope we all, and help a one one each other and have lots of time.

00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm mostly interested in data visualization and data cleaning.

312
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So therefore I'm here to, to learn more about this side of the data analysis.

326
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Most of my professional experience background comes from the supply and procurement departments, but since I'm working now for a startup company here in Valencia.

327
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm excited to take the bootcamp in data analytics and try to make a switch in my professional career and try to start working on that, because I see the opportunity in the company that I'm working for today.

328
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So, very excited and that's it for the moment and going to pass the ball to Daniel.

331
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't know I can specifically based on I think sports companies because I'm trying to get the knowledge that allow me to to change up basically and go for a more technical role and hopefully one day to a developer role.

332
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And maybe the reason, and yeah, can wait to start honestly, and very excited about it. And that will pass the ball to Separna.

333
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So, I'm going to ask you one. Nice to meet you to everyone today.

334
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Basically I am from India.

335
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Recently I am living in Netherlands.

336
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I want to switch my career in data science as it is happening, and it's, I thought it's a next future is in data.

337
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And I am very much excited to join the bootcamp and learn, learn from that data and I have little bit knowledge in the language, but not Python details, knowledge in Python.

338
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I am excited to learn Python and other area of technique from bootcamp. And yeah, I am really looking forward to learn from bootcamp and from my data commits.

339
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And that's all.

340
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And.

341
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Lamia, I don't know. Lamia.

342
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, I've already talked about the there are people in the chat for, I would like to introduce themselves.

343
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's true. I think we are meeting a better.

344
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah.

345
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,760
Hi everyone, I'm Afridita. I'm from Kosovo, recently moved to Germany. I've got a master in MBA

346
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,400
with focus in finance and international business. You have worked over five years as a business

347
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,560
consultant, but in Kosovo. So when I moved to Germany, I saw the differences in the

348
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:30,960
technology involvement to everything where Germany is like five years ahead of Kosovo.

349
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:40,240
So I saw my weak spots somewhere I lacked. Back home, usually I would take the data already from

350
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,760
the business analyst and then I would work upon that to bring up the business decisions.

351
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,800
And now I'm excited to compliment my skills, learning new stuff, challenge myself and

352
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,400
become better for myself and also raise the perspective of myself on finding a better job

353
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:10,160
here in Germany. I've always been scared of Python. I was right. It's very hard, but I think I started

354
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:17,200
getting the hand of it, but it's a very way long to go. Nice to meet you everybody.

355
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,680
I don't know who's next, but yeah. I think we have one person left. Amelie?

356
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:33,760
Nice, thank you. So I'm from Munich, but living in beautiful Lisbon since

357
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:41,280
one year already, I'm flying. Well, you all know my profession. I'm program manager for data

358
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:48,160
analytics courses at IronHack. This is how I got curious about data analytics. To be honest,

359
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,600
I never thought that I would take a data bootcamp, but in the end, yeah, I got a little bit

360
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,080
influencers as well. So I decided to join you with the journey and start the bootcamp with you as

361
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:09,120
well on Tuesday. Excellent. You're very welcome. Okay, so I think that everyone, I hope I'm not

362
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:17,120
forgetting anyone, just if you are, like, speak now or forever or ever old your piece. Okay,

363
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:28,480
there we go. Talk about it for our day zero. I hope you got something out of it. We're going to

364
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:36,080
meet back again tomorrow, not tomorrow, sorry, on Tuesday, getting ahead of myself at 6.30 again,

365
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:46,160
CT. If you, if there's anything that you want to discuss on a more one or one on this, like,

366
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,760
toolkit that we just discussed, if there's something that you're not sure if you have

367
00:56:51,760 --> 00:57:01,280
well installed or if it's working, just stay a while and we'll go through it. Yeah, otherwise.

368
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:09,120
Hope you have a great weekend. The last one you'll have for a while. I am kind of promising you

369
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:24,000
that already. See you all on Tuesday. Have a nice weekend. Have a nice weekend.
